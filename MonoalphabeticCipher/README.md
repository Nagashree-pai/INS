# 🔐 Substitution Cipher - Simple Letter Mapping Encryption

## 📜 Definition  
The **Substitution Cipher** is a **monoalphabetic cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from a shuffled alphabet. This encryption method is simple yet effective for basic text encoding.

## ✨ Features  
✅ Uses a **fixed substitution mapping** for encryption  
✅ Simple and fast encryption and decryption  
✅ Supports **both uppercase and lowercase** letters  
✅ Keeps special characters **unchanged**  

---

## 🚀 Usage  

### 🔹 Encryption  
1. Replace each letter in the plaintext with its corresponding **substituted letter**.  
2. Non-alphabetic characters remain **unchanged**.  

### 🔹 Decryption  
1. Reverse the substitution by **mapping back** from the encrypted text.  
2. Retrieve the **original message** by replacing each substituted letter.

## 🛠️ Example  

```plaintext
Input:
Plaintext: hello

Output:
Ciphertext: ITSSG

Input:
Ciphertext: ITSSG

Output:
Decrypted Text: hello
```

## 📋 Requirements  
- Python **3.x** installed  

---

## ▶️ How to Run  

1️⃣ Save the script as `substitution_cipher.py`  
2️⃣ Open a terminal and navigate to the script location  
3️⃣ Run the script using:  
   
   ```bash
   python substitution_cipher.py
   ```
   
4️⃣ Enter your **plaintext** to encrypt  
5️⃣ Enter the **ciphertext** to decrypt
